Seda is the professional association for staff and educational developers in the UK. 

I was tasked with creating landing pages for a project which incorporated learning pathways, in conjunction with Canvas. I also conducted a thorough Accessibility and SEO audit on the site, this included checking the site against the guidelines form the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/).

Tech Stack: 

* PHP
* HTML 
* CSS
