For my graduate project at university I created a marketing campaign for a number of research projects at Bournemouth University. There were three parts to this project. 

The first part was a social media campaign and the platform I utilised was Instagram. you can view the account [here](https://www.instagram.com/heif_at_bu/). 

The second part included three different video documentaries, that highlighted a few of these projects. you can view one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_txroStow0).

The final part of this project was the creation of a new section on the BU Research Website, this can be found [here](https://research.bournemouth.ac.uk/innovation-funding/).
