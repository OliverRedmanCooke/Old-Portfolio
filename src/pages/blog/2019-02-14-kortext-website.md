Kortext is the UKâ€™s leading personal learning platform and supplier of digital textbooks. I was brought on board when the company wanted to merge two of their exsisting sites. These included a Wordpress Marketing Site and a Nopcommerce Store. 

We merged the two onto the Nopcommerce platform, creating a site with a mix of Landing pages for B2C and B2B, as well as an extensive eCommerce solution.

Tech Stack: 

* C# and .Net Core
* SQL 
* Foundation Framework
